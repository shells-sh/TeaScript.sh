# `$ reflection`

üçµ TeaScript Reflection API

TeaScript `reflection` provides a read-only interface for introspecting
on TeaScript types and variables as well as a write interface for defining
or making changes to types.

## Reference

- [`reflection objects`](#reflection-objects)
- [`reflection types`](#reflection-types)
- [`reflection variables`](#reflection-variables)

```sh
class Dog implements IAnimal do <<- _
  Represents a dog
  _

  field name: String
  field age: Integer
end

reflection types getTypeInterface Dog
# => "IAnimal"

reflection types getTypeComment Dog
# => "Represents a dog"

reflection types getFieldNames Dog
# => "name age"

reflection types getFieldType Dog age
# => "Integer"
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: `reflection` performs no argument assertions or validation  
> e.g. you can create a variable of a type that does not exist using `reflection variables`.
>
> Higher-level functions such as `var` and `class` and `def` perform these assertions and type-checking.

### üíª Developer Notes

> _Inline all the things!_

üå∂Ô∏è **Reminder:** most of this file is in the _very hot path_ of TeaScript!

Do not attempt to "DRY" this code or refactor it to use meaningful variable names.

This code should be "wet" with as much inline code as possible.

**Never** attempt to refactor code into utility methods and, for example, then call `reflection utils something` within you code. Just - NO.

To the extent possible, **never** start any subshells or run other programs. This means NO `grep` or `sed` or `awk`. Use built-in BASH string manipulation when possible.

Try not to allocate new native BASH variables. Instead, reuse variables as much as possible (_and limit use of variables, in general - prefer literal strings_). All BASH locals should be prefixed `__T_`.

Do not loop over values. Usually, if you are writing a loop, you are adding an `O(N)` or worse, do not do it.
Notable exception for [`addMethod`]() which takes a dynamic number of arguments for defining any number of parameters.
In general, keep everything `O(1)` as much as possible. User-friendly functions which are not on the hot path are allowed
to break these rules.

#### `eval`

To start with, various functions make use of `eval`. In fact, most do.

This is to support Mac's built-in version of BASH, which is BASH `3.2.57` and will always be this version due to `GPL` licensing.

After `reflection.sh` is mostly "complete" (_i.e. once `var` and `expression` and `class` and `def` are fully up-and-running_)
we will add Docker tests for both BASH `3.2.57` as well as the latest versions of BASH 5 which is distributed
with Linux and used on Windows as well and create 2 versions of `reflection.sh`, one targetting BASH 4.3+ which removes all use of `eval`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `eval` is used for defining single-dimensional array variables with dynamic names
> and modifying or reading from those arrays. In BASH 4.3+ these operations are doable by making
> use of `declare -g` and `typeset -n`.
>
> When we create the `eval`less version of `reflection.sh`, we will do benchmarking to see if the `eval`less
> version is _faster_ on BASH 5 or if it's actually slower than `eval`.
> It might turn out that `typeset -n` is prohibitively slow and the copy of `reflection.sh`
> might just use `declare -g` but otherwise be identical. We will see! Can't wait to try and to benchmark :)

#### Character Codes

> `p` private -_vs_- `P` public

Some of this code uses user-unfriendly archaic looking characters to represent various bits of type metadata.

This contains a lookup table for all characters.

> Note: most of the read-only reflection functions such as `reflection types getFieldVisibility` return friendly names such as `public` or `private`.
>
> These functions are not used in any path of the core TeaScript engine and perform name conversions.
>
> Other functions such as `reflection types define` expect these characters to be provided as arguments and _do not support_ friendly names such as `public` (use `P` instead).
>
> All functions used by the core TeaScript engine are marked with the hot pepper noting the hot path üå∂Ô∏è (TODO!)

| Character | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `a` | `abstract` |
| `c` | `class` |
| `i` | `interface` |
| `n` | Named reference, e.g. marking a variable as being a reference to another variable |
| `p` | `private` |
| `P` | `public` |
| `r` | Reference, e.g. marking a type as being a reference type or a variable as containing a reference |
| `s` | `struct` |
| `S` | `static` |
| `v` | Value, e.g. marking a type as being a value type or a variable as containing a value |

#### TeaScript use of BASH arrays

BASH 4.0 introduces associative arrays.

Mac OS X uses a wicked old version of BASH: `3.2.57` (as mentioned above)

TeaScript is built from the ground up to support `3.2.57` so that it works out-of-the-box on Mac OS X.

However, even if TeaScript did make use of BASH associative arrays, they are still flat objects with a simple text value key/index and a simple text string value.

BASH associative arrays wouldn't actually benefit the TeaScript implementation a whole lot.

So we make the best use of BASH arrays by:

- Storing various bits of metadata inside of single indices
- Proving out own key --> index lookups

See [`reflection objects`](#reflection-objects), [`types`](#reflection-types), and [`variables`](#reflection-variables) for descriptions of how we store each of these using BASH arrays.

## `reflection objects`

Manages the TeaScript **Heap** where objects are allocated.

Objects are `create`'d (_allocated_) and `dispose`'d of (_deallocated_).

All created objects are provided a unique Object ID identifier for
referencing the object, e.g. from a variable.

You can think of objects as simple key/value stores.

The object does *not* know the *types* of the keys/values, that information is stored on the type.

Every object has:

  1. a unique object ID identifier (_see [Object IDs](#-Object-IDs) below for more info on how these are generated_)
  2. a Type name, e.g. `String` or `Integer`
  3. keys and values (these are stored as simple strings, each value in its own index of a single-dimensional BASH array)

### ‚ûó Object IDs

Object IDs are generated via [`/dev/urandom`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random).

> _In Unix-like operating systems, /dev/random, /dev/urandom and /dev/arandom are special files that serve as pseudorandom number generators._  
> ~ wikipedia

The random portion of Object IDs is 32 characters long.

The specific command TeaScript uses to generate object IDs is:

```sh
cat /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1
```

### üóëÔ∏è Garbage Collection

Unlike variables, which are managed on the stack within a given scope,
objects are not automatically disposed of when a variable goes out of scope.

To deallocate objects which are no longer being referenced,
the garbage collector must be run which disposes of all objects
which are no longer being references by: variables or other objects.

You can run the garbage collector at any time via: `reflection objects gc run`

To simply view objects which are no longer in use and would be reaped and disposed of
by the garbage collector, you can run `reflection objects gc unused`

### üé® BASH Data Representation

Objects are represented in BASH single-dimensional array structures (see [TeaScript use of BASH arrays](#TeaScript-use-of-BASH-arrays) above)

TODO: details

### `reflection objects create`

Creates an object of a given type and allocates it on the heap.

The object ID is provided to the caller by passing the name of a variable and this function
will set the variable value to the object ID. This allows calling `reflection objects create`
outside of a subshell.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è At the time of writing, you cannot currently provide key/value fields to `reflection objects create`,
> you must use `setField` for every individual field.

#### üóëÔ∏è Garbage Collection

TeaScript automatically runs a garbage collector when a certain number of objects have been allocated.

This can be configured by setting the `T_GC_OBJECT_THRESHOLD` variable to an integer value (default: `1000`).

To disable automatic garbage collection, `unset T_GC_OBJECT_THRESHOLD`.

Be sure to set or unset `T_GC_OBJECT_THRESHOLD` _after_ sourcing `teascript.sh`.

You can run the garbage collector manually at any time by running: `reflection objects gc run`.

See [`objects gc`](#reflection-objects-gc) for more details.

## `reflection types`

Manages the TeaScript types in the TeaScript type system.

Types are `define`'d and `undefine`'d.

Types are used for describing the shape and behavior of objects and values.

Every type has a "type", e.g. it is a `class` or a `struct` etc. We call these the 'descriptor' (_to reduce confusion, it's really the type type_).

In addition to classes, value types such as literal primitives (`string`, `int`, et al)
and `struct` are also described using TeaScript types.

### üé® BASH Data Representation

Variables are represented in BASH single-dimensional array structures (see [TeaScript use of BASH arrays](#TeaScript-use-of-BASH-arrays) above)

```sh
reflection types define Array [...]
# => T_TYPE_Array

reflection types define Array[T]
# => T_TYPE_Array_GENERIC_T

reflection types define Map[K,V]
# => T_TYPE_Map_GENERIC_K_V
```

| `T_TYPE_` index | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `0` | Descriptor name or code, e.g. `c` for `class`, `s` for `struct` et al (see [codes reference](#Character-Codes) above), followed b full type name, e.g. `Array` or `Array[T|`, followed by base class and interfaces, with comment if provided |
| `1` | Field lookup table, mapping field named to index value where field definition is stored |
| `2` | Method lookup table, mapping method name to index value where method definition is stored |

```sh
T_TYPE_Array_GENERIC_T=([0]="Array[T];s|Object<IEnumerable,IComparable>This represents a typed array of a provided generic type.")
```

### `reflection types define`

Define a new type, e.g. a `class` or a `struct`

`TODO`: disallow defining both `Collection[A]` and `Collection[B]` because instantiating `Collection[Dog]` will not know which to choose from.
        at the time of writing, `reflection types define` will allow both of these types to be defined.
        considering taking the # of generics and using that? or... hmm. yes, I like this. If you really want `Collection`, `Collection[A]`, and `Collection[A,B]` - sure, go ahead. We can instantiate fine.

| | Parameter |
|-|-----------|
| `$1` | `types` |
| `$2` | `define` |
| `$3` | Full type name with generic, e.g. `Array[T]` or `Map[K,V]` or `Dog` |
| `$4` | Descriptor name or code, e.g. `c` for `class` or `s` for `struct`. For extensibility, this is stored/used raw if not a known built-in code, allowing definition of one's own descriptors. |
| `$5` | Base class name (or empty string) |
| `$6` | Interface names (comma-delimited without spaces) (or empty string) |
| `$7` | Comment text, if any. Note: this is only persisted if `T_COMMENTS=enabled` (default value in development environment) |

### `reflection types exists`

Return 0 if a type with the provided name exists else returns 1.

Note: for generics, this should be the type name as it was originally defined.  
e.g. if there is a defined `Collection[T]`, then `exists Collection[T]` will succeed
but `exists Collection[K]` will fail.

## `reflection snapshots`

You can save the state of your TeaScript program to a snapshot and load it later.

You can specify whether to snapshot just types or also variables etc.

Can be serialized and reloaded for faster program boot time.

Can reduce snapshot size as well with option to remove all type comments.

## `reflection variables`

Manages the TeaScript **Stack** where in-scope variables are allocated.

Variables are `set` and `unset`.

### üé® BASH Data Representation
